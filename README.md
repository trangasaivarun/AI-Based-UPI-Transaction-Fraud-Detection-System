# üîê UPI Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

An end-to-end web-based machine learning project that detects **fraudulent UPI transactions**. This tool enables users to verify single or batch UPI transactions via a simple Streamlit interface and is backed by a highly accurate XGBoost classifier trained on real-world data.

## üìñ Introduction
Digital payments through UPI have revolutionized financial transactions in India. However, this growth has also increased the risk of fraud. This project presents a machine learning-based solution to detect UPI fraud using transactional patterns and behavior.

Built with a user-friendly Streamlit interface, it allows:
- üì• Input of single or bulk transaction details
- ü§ñ Real-time fraud detection
- üìà Visual insights and downloadable results

The system integrates a well-optimized ML model with practical UI design to ensure ease of use, transparency, and security.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset contains over **50,000 UPI transactions** with features like:

- `amount`
- `transaction_type`
- `payment_gateway`
- `merchant_category`
- `transaction_state`
- `date` (used to extract `month` and `year`)

**Target:** Binary class ‚Äî Fraudulent or Legitimate transaction

Preprocessing includes:
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

## ü§ñ Model Details
- **Model:** XGBoost Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** 99.53%  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Precision: 99.57%
  - Recall: 99.50%
  - F1-Score: 99.53%
  - ROC-AUC: 99.94%

Model evaluation was performed using hold-out validation and k-fold cross-validation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîπ Single Transaction Mode
1. Input transaction details manually
2. Model predicts if it‚Äôs fraudulent
3. Probability and transaction summary shown

### üîπ Batch Mode
1. Upload a CSV file of transactions
2. System processes and predicts fraud
3. Displays insights and allows CSV download
